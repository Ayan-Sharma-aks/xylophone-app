# xylophone-app
Created a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are. 

- Incorporated open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
- Generated repeated user interface Widgets.
- Used Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
- Made use of Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
